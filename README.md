# Overview

![paper](./assets/main_process.png)

WebGLM aspires to provide an efficient and cost-effective web-enhanced question-answering system using the 10-billion-parameter General Language Model (GLM). It aims to improve real-world application deployment by integrating web search and retrieval capabilities into the pre-trained language model.

## Features

-   **LLM-augmented Retriever**: Enhances the retrieval of relevant web content to better aid in answering questions accurately.
-   **Bootstrapped Generator**: Generates human-like responses to questions, leveraging the power of the GLM to provide refined answers.
-   **Human Preference-aware Scorer**: Estimates the quality of generated responses by prioritizing human preferences, ensuring the system produces useful and engaging content.

# Preparation

## Prepare Code and Environments

Clone this repo, and install python requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Nodejs.

```bash
apt install nodejs # If you use Ubuntu
```

Install playwright dependencies.

```bash
playwright install
```

If browsing environments are not installed in your host, you need to install them. Do not worry, playwright will give you instructions when you first execute it if so.

## Prepare SerpAPI Key

In search process, we use SerpAPI to get search results. You need to get a SerpAPI key from [here](https://serpapi.com/).

Then, set the environment variable `SERPAPI_KEY` to your key.

```bash
export SERPAPI_KEY="YOUR KEY"
```

## Prepare Retriever Checkpoint

Download the checkpoint on [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/54056861b2f34bbfb3f9/) by running the command line below.

You can manually specify the path to save the checkpoint by `--save SAVE_PATH`.

```bash
python download.py retriever-pretrained-checkpoint
```

# Try WebGLM

Before you run the code, make sure that the space of your device is enough.

## Export Environment Variables

Export the environment variable `WEBGLM_RETRIEVER_CKPT` to the path of the retriever checkpoint. If you have downloaded the retriever checkpoint in the default path, you can simply run the command line below.

```bash
export WEBGLM_RETRIEVER_CKPT=./download/retriever-pretrained-checkpoint
```

## Run as Command Line Interface

You can try WebGLM-2B model by:
    
```bash
python cli_demo.py -w THUDM/WebGLM-2B
```
    
Or directly for WebGLM-10B model:
    
```bash
python cli_demo.py
```
    
    
## Run as Web Service

You can try WebGLM-2B model by:
    
```bash
python web_demo.py -w THUDM/WebGLM-2B
```
    
Or directly for WebGLM-10B model:
    
```bash
python web_demo.py
```
    
# Train WebGLM

## Train Generator

### Prepare Data

Download the training data on [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/ae204894f2e842f19a3f/) by running the command line below.

```bash
python download.py generator-training-data
```

It will automatically download all the data and preprocess them into the seq2seq form that can be used immediately in `./download`.

### Training

Please refer to [GLM repo](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM#train-with-your-own-data) for seq2seq training.

## Train Retriever

### Prepare Data

Download the training data on [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/fa5e6eb1afac4f08a4c6/) by running the command line below.

```bash
python download.py retriever-training-data
```

### Training

Run the following command line to train the retriever. If you have downloaded the retriever training data in the default path, you can simply run the command line below.

```bash
python train_retriever.py --train_data_dir ./download/retriever-training-data
```

# Evaluation

You can reproduce our results on TriviaQA, WebQuestions and NQ Open. Take TriviaQA for example, you can simply run the command line below:

```bash
bash scripts/triviaqa.sh
```

and start running the experiment.

# Real Application Cases

[Here](assets/cases) you can see some examples of WebGLM real application scenarios.
